        <h3>High Trestle Bridge, IA</h3>
        <div class=bridge><img src=Pictures\DSC_0256.jpg class=one></div>
        <div class=desc><p>Day 1 of my road trip ended with a sunset mission to this beautiful bridge located 45 mins north of Des Moines. I didn't think I was going to make it because of how tight my itinerary was but I'm very glad that I made it in time.</p></div><br>
        
        <h3>Lion's Den Gorge Nature Preserve, WI</h3>
        <div class=gorge><img src=Pictures\DSC_0464.jpg class=two><br><img src=Pictures\DSC_0471.jpg class=two></div>
        <div class=desc><p>Day 7 of my road trip began with a sunrise mission to a beach overlooking Lake Michigan located 30 mins north of Milwaukee. I woke up around 5 am and procrastinated for about 30 mins before I decided to push myself out of bed and chase the sun that was slated to rise around 7 am. When I got to the beach, which was about 1.5 kms from the trailhead, I was greeted with some amazing views and I made myself a pour over coffee to enjoy it.</p></div><br>
        
        <h3>Devil's Doorway, Devil's Lake State Park, WI</h3>
        <div class=door><img src=Pictures\DSC_0611.jpg class=two><br><img src=Pictures\DSC_0607.jpg class=two></div>
        <div class=desc><p>Day 8 of my road trip ended with a sunset mission to this awe-inspiring viewpoint located at Devil's Lake State Park located about 2 hrs west of Milwaukee. This day consisted on 3 hikes totalling almost 20 kms. I was getting exhausted at this point of the day but the thought of the sunset view kept me going. Definitely no regrets about it.</p></div><br>
        
        <h3>West Bluff, Devil's Lake State Park, WI</h3>
        <div class=door><img src=Pictures\DSC_0633.jpg class=one></div>
        <div class=desc><p>Day 9 of my road trip began with a sunrise mission to the other side of the lake from where the Devil's Doorway is located. Getting myself out of my tent was even harder than my first sunrise hike because of the amount of hiking I did the day before but I ultimately mustered up all the motivtion I can gather to get it done. The views were immaculate and the fresh coffee was equally as good.</p></div><br>
                
        <h3>Brady's Bluff, Perrot State Park, WI</h3>
        <div class=gorge><img src=Pictures\DSC_0767.jpg class=two><br><img src=Pictures\DSC_0764.jpg class=two></div>
        <div class=desc><p>Day 10 of my road trip ended with a sunset mission to Brady's Bluff located at Perrot State Park, about 2.5 hrs southeast of Minneapolis along the interstate on Minnesota and Wisconsin. This was on a cloudy day and I wasn't sure if the sun was going to come out for a sunset view. I took a gamble and did the hike anyways and I was greeted by some phenomenal views and a sunset view that didn't last very long but it was definitely worth it.</p></div><br>

        <h3>Fire Tower, Itasca State Park, MN</h3>
        <div class=gorge><img src=Pictures\DSC_0890.jpg class=two><br><img src=Pictures\DSC_0900.jpg class=two></div>
        <div class=desc><p>Day 14 of my road trip ended with a sunset mission to the Fire Tower of Itasca State Park, about 2 hrs east of Grand Forks, ND. This was the last night of my road trip and many emotions were flowing through me. I was both sad that my road trip was coming to an end and also relieved to be going home after such a long trip.</p></div><br>
